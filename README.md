SiteBuild
=========

A tool to build a static website from a collection of files in a dynamic way.

Setup: SiteBuild is able to process Markdown, to enable this functionality you
must download Markdown here: http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/
The zip option will be simplest, you must ensure that the extracted folder 
called 'Michelf' is placed inside the 'library' folder, it will then be detected
automatically.
